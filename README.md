# Case_Studies_f3_fMRI
Group work Case studies 

We analysed an An fMRI dataset for whole-body somatotopic mapping in humans, which was downloaded from openneuro: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004044/versions/2.0.3

In our Github we have two main maps (SPM and Nilearn). We tried out both these tools to learn about fMRI analysis, but eventually we focused mainly on SPM in order to replicate a somatopic motor map of the brain.
